# Unit-2--Build-Week-Project
 If you’ve ever looked into buying a diamond then you know how confusing it can get when trying to determine what factors will help you get the most bang for your buck and what causes your diamond to be more or less valuable. When you begin your initial research the first thing you’ll learn is the 4 C’s of diamonds. Those are cut, color, clarity, and carat. The deeper you dive into your research the more opinions you’ll read about which combination of the 4 C’s will result in a more beautiful ring. Having recently gone through the engagement ring shopping experience, I wanted to see for myself which of these diamond characteristics impact the price of a diamond.

 I used a dataset that contained about 53,000 observations on 10 different diamond features. The features are carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, x (length), y (width), z (height).
 
 I built Linear, Ridge, XGB, and Random Forest Regression models to better predict the price of a diamond.
