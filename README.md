 If youâ€™ve ever looked into buying a diamond then you know how confusing it can be when trying to determine what factors will help you get the most bang for your buck and what causes your diamond to be more or less valuable. I wanted to see for myself which of these diamond characteristics impact the price of a diamond and build a model to more accurately predict the price based on the features of the given diamond.

 I used a dataset that contained about 53,000 observations on 10 different diamond features. The features are carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, x (length), y (width), z (height).
 
 I built Linear, Ridge, XGB, and Random Forest Regression models to better predict the price of a diamond.
